### Bullying

Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. Kids who are bullied can experience negative physical, social, emotional, academic, and mental health issues.

While OLP may not frequently witness physical aggressive bullying passive bullying is more endemic and harder to detect. The outcomes from both can have similar longer term outcomes. Bullying as well as its outcomes are contrary to OLP principles and necessitate an aggressive response.

- OLP should develop and maintain a bullying identification and prevention training program. Here are a few good starter resources:
  - `CDC` developed [A Comprehensive Technical Package for the Prevention of Youth Violence and Associated Risk Behaviors](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/yv-technicalpackage.pdf).
  - `stopbullying.gov` developed [Bullying Prevention Training Module ](https://www.stopbullying.gov/sites/default/files/2017-09/training-module-2016.pdf)

### Cyberbullying

Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. Outcomes of cyberbulying are similar to bullying.

Cyberbullying is differentiated from bullying on two accounts:

- Permanence: As digital content it can be replicated and have a much longer shelf life.
- Hidden: As the bullying channel may be public and may exist outside school boundaries, it could be harder to detect and remedy.

Digital media has developed into a immense medium for children. It is recommended OLP develop a stand alone cyberbullying identification and prevention training program. Here are a few good starter resources:

- `stopbullying.com` developed [How to Prevent Cyberbullying](https://www.stopbullying.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Cyberbullying%20Guide%20Final%20508.pdf)
