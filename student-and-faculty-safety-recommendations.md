### Bullying

Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. Kids who are bullied can experience negative physical, social, emotional, academic, and mental health issues.

While OLP may not frequently witness physical aggressive bullying passive bullying is more endemic and harder to detect. The outcomes from both can have similar longer term outcomes. Bullying as well as its outcomes are contrary to OLP principles and necessitate an aggressive response.

- OLP should develop and maintain a bullying identification and prevention training program. Here are a few good starter resources:

  - `CDC` developed [A Comprehensive Technical Package for the Prevention of Youth Violence and Associated Risk Behaviors](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/yv-technicalpackage.pdf).
  - `stopbullying.gov` developed [Bullying Prevention Training Module](https://www.stopbullying.gov/sites/default/files/2017-09/training-module-2016.pdf)

### Cyberbullying

Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. Outcomes of cyberbulying are similar to bullying.

Cyberbullying is differentiated from bullying on two accounts:

- Permanence: As digital content it can be replicated and have a much longer shelf life.
- Hidden: As the bullying channel may be public and may exist outside school boundaries, it could be harder to detect and remedy.

Digital media has developed into a immense medium for children. It is recommended OLP develop a stand alone cyberbullying identification and prevention training program. Here are a few good starter resources:

- `stopbullying.com` developed [How to Prevent Cyberbullying](https://www.stopbullying.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Cyberbullying%20Guide%20Final%20508.pdf)

### Threat Assessment and Reporting

A threat to school students and faculty can come from internal or external sources. A threat warning can mitigate potential impact if it is received and acted upon in a timely manner. School security personnel may obtain information through more traditional sources, such as student discussions with trusted teachers or social media monitoring.

It is recommended that OLP develop and maintain a threat reporting and assessment program.

- One or more personnel be identified for spearheading this initiative.
- Students and faculty be familiarized with the resources and protocol for reporting threats.

Here is a good starter resource:

- National Institute of Justice (nij.ojp.gov) developed [School Safety: Research on Gathering Tips and Addressing Threats](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/school-safety-research-gathering-tips-and-addressing-threats?utm_campaign=justinfo&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)

### Physical Security

Physical security measures can mitigate external threats and reduce the amount of harm inflicted if incidents occur. Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is an approach that focuses on improving the design of the built environment to help reduce opportunities for disputes and violence and promote positive behavior. CPTED appears to be a holistic approach to environment reconditioning with a focus on security. OLP will need to identify the specific environmental recommendations applicable in its case and draft a plan to implement the same.

A recommendation is made for completing an Center for Disease & Prevention (cdc.gov) drafted [Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) School Assessment (CSA)](https://rems.ed.gov/docs/CDC_CPTEDSchoolAssessment.pdf)

Here are some good starter resources:

- Florida Department of Education drafted [CPTED School Assessment](http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/MSDHS/Meetings/June-Meeting-Documents/Presentations/June-7-200PM-OAG-Hushen-CPTED.aspx)
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov) developed [Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/youthviolence/cpted.html)
- Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security agency (cisa.gov) developed [k-12-school-security-guide](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/k-12-school-security-guide)
- U.S. Department of Education developed [Mobile Application for K-12 Schools physical security evaluation](https://rems.ed.gov/SITEASSESS.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1)

### Cyber security

Like any modern organization reliant on digital infrastructure OLP faces challenges securing these infrastructure components. Failing to secure them can have far reaching consequence.

OLP needs to be aware of the following cyber challenges:

- Data Breach

  A data breach is a leak or spill of sensitive, protected, or confidential data.

- Spoofing/Phishing

  These are common cyber theft attack vectors.

- Malware/Scareware/Ransomware

  Software that can spread and disrupt the OLP digital environment.

- Unpatched or Outdated Software Vulnerabilities

  Unpatched/outdated software is a favoured attack vector for cyber attacks.

OLP should develop and maintain a cybersecurity incident protocol.

Another recommendation is for OLP to fill out a cyber security evaluation to locate the gaps in cyber infrastructure security.

Basic cyber security recommendations:

- Frequent rotation of infrastructure passwords (e.g. school wifi, databases, web server credentials etc.)
- Consider 2-factory authentication.
- Network monitoring capability.
- Develop and publish a reporting mechanism. Help students identify and report security gaps.

Here are some good starter resources:

- U.S. Department of education developed [Cybersecurity Considerations for K-12 Schools](https://rems.ed.gov/docs/Cybersecurity_K-12_Fact_Sheet_508C.PDF)
